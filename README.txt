Battlefieldtools.com - Windows servertool 0.7.2

This program has been ported to Windows by VincentWhite, in a hope of extending our software to other users, especially ones without linux knowledge who want to use our tool.

This program is built upon the very popular XAMPP by Apache Friends, which has been modified in order to give you the core functionality needed to run the tool.

To get started with the windows version of the tool, double click on setup_servertool.bat to kick start the installation process. Once this is complete make sure to 
run start_servertool.bat to get the servertool up and running on your system! From here, simply point your webbrowser to http://localhost to install the tool and 
start managing your server in an easy and simple manner.

Whilst every effort has been made to ensure that this program is safe and 100% secure from any malicious attacks
or potential security breaches, all computers and networks are unique and there a few steps you can take to ensure that
your security remains unbroken whilst using this software.

Whilst running this software, you will be running a webserver on your local machine. This is not usually a problem, but can be
if your network is setup to portforward into your computer on port 80, or otherwise running on a DMZ. 
This is not usually the case, however we would recommend that you check with your internet service provider or your network 
administrator if you are unsure of this information.

This software is designed to be used locally only. The security settings have been designed to work locally and not to be 
broadcast on the internet or be connected to using http externally. Please DO NOT use this webserver or mysql database to run
a live website or webservice on that is contactable from the outside world. Even if you know what you are doing, this is
probably a really dumb idea ;)
